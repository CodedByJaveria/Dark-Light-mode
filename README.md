ðŸŒ— Toggle Mode (Dark/Light Mode)

This project is a simple implementation of a dark and light theme switcher using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to toggle between light mode and dark mode by clicking a button. The theme changes instantly without refreshing the page.

# Features:

Easy toggle between light and dark mode

Smooth transition effects

Uses classList.toggle() in JavaScript to switch themes

Minimal and user-friendly design


# Technologies Used:

* HTML

* CSS

* JavaScript (Event Listener & DOM Manipulation)


#  How it Works:

When the toggle button is clicked, JavaScript adds or removes a class (like .dark-mode) to the <body>. The CSS file contains styles for both light and dark themes, and switching the class changes the entire appearanceÂ ofÂ theÂ site.
